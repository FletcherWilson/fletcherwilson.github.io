            <i><p>frustrated. I feel i didnt have a clear enough understanding of the task to complete it.</p></i>
            <p><b>What did you learn?</b> </p>
            <i><p>trial and error sometimes does not work, google cannot solve all my problems and asking for help may
               not give me the answers i need either.</p></i>

        <h2>Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you:</h2>

          <ol>Solved a problem in an elegant way.</ol>
            <p><b> What was the problem? </b> </p>
            <i><p>the first rep.it challenge, read the tests and trial and errored my way through it. felt good to
              chaieve it through making assumptions and going with your gut.</p></i>
            <p><b>What problem solving techniques did you use?</b> </p>
            <i><p>trial and error</p></i>
            <p><b> What was the problem? How did you feel throughout the process?</p>
            <i><p>read the tests and solved each one, one by one.</p></i>
            <p><b>What did you learn?</b> </p>
            <i><p>the value of tests, however this technique did not work for me the next time as i reach a point
              here i could not get past and honestly i felt there was a bug or a simple typo that was missed by me
              and there wasnt enouigh time to muck around on it. </p></i>

Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:

<b>Pseudocode</b>
  <i><p>confident that when i know exactly how to work through it i can form good plans, getting into the routine
    to do this may be difficult, as instictively i jump straight in.</p></i>
<b>Trying something</b>
  <i><p>i take this as trrial and error, this seems to be the main thing i do.</p></i>
<b>Rubber ducky method</b>
  <i><p>will work well i imagine when i know the subject better</p></i>
<b>Reading error messages</b>
  <i><p>this is very helpful for the trial and error process</p></i>
<b>Console.logging</b>
  <i><p>similar to the above, will use as a guide for what is working and what is not</p></i>
<b>Googling</b>
  <i><p>my main go to! if in doubt google it and use trial and error</p></i>
<b>Asking your peers for help</b>
  <i><p>last resort, will do it more when im in regular contact with my peers</p></i>
<b>Asking coaches for help</b>
  <i><p>often when i ask my coach for help, i have resolved the problem prior to him answering the question. So now
  i wait till im totally stuck and about to give up prior to asking a question</p></i>
<b>Improving your process with reflection</b>
  <i><p>i think this is helpful for clarifying and solidifying things into memory</p></i>
