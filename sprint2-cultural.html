      <h2><strong>Learning Plan</<strong></h2>

        <h3><b>A description of your own strengths and limitations</b></h3>

        <h4><b>Limitations</b></h4>
        <i>Haven’t done a hell of a lot of programming, am keeping up but its clear I’m not as skilled as some of the other learners.</i>
        <h4><b>Strengths</b></h4>
        <i>Readily available, I don’t have many commitments that are likely to impede on the learning group. I have good facilities, communication skills and strive to do my best and will do what I say I can do. Will also clearly inform other learners and staff when I am not certain I will be able to complete a given task.</i>

        <h3><b>Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives</b></h3>
        <i>I have already begun matching the bootcamp time periods while doing the foundations, this way when the bootcamps begin. I will have acclimatised to the routine. I will arrive on time, prepared and in a state to complete the work at hand. I will treat students, facilitators and industry representatives with respect and constructively take on their advice.</i>

        <h3><b>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
        <i>I have initially been seeking out help from my facilitator but only when stuck, I have begun becoming more self-dependant with searching for answers on the net, which often are found. I will reach out to student and staff if I cannot solve the problem myself in a timely fasion.</i>

        <h3><b>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h3>
        <i>Reasonable goals, some past work experiences I have had managers who are unaware of the time it takes to complete tasks, which are not possible. As long as the request are possible given the level of knowledge then ill be happy.</i>

        <h3><b>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things</b></h3>
        <i>As above there are very few things in my life that I cannot reorganise to suit the current goal, of learning code. I operate a couple of apartments in the viaduct, sometimes I may have to deal with various issues, but these are likely to be short time spans.</i>
