      <h3><ol>Research Neuroplasticity</ol></h3>

      <h3>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</ol></h3>
      <p>According to Dr.Dweck when people understand that there brain is maliable and that its constantly changing, it shows people that things can change and they can learn, this removed doubt and creates opportunity</p>

      <h3>Discuss how might engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for your own benefit</h3>
      <p>Understanding neuroplasticity and reminding oneself of the benefits of it can motiviate you to learn things you would potentially dissmiss as too difficult. engaging with this mindset will open doors that otherwise you may have kept closed on your own. </p>
      <h3>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity</h3>
      <p>repetition, practice, a 'not yet' mentality, mindfulness in the now focus.</p>
      <h3>Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging.</h3>
      <p>waking up app - a meditation app. In moments when you feel overwhelmed, take a moment and do a guided meditation. then when in a calm state remind yourself that this is a not yet situation and these things can be learned and will be if enough practice and repetition is done.</p>

      <p> I had seen both videos before, but cetainly had a different perspective as I had seen them a long time ago, I've changed a bit since then. My circumstances are quite different too as now I am in the need of a learning growth mindset, where before was working and my mindset was was essentailly fixed. </p>
      <h3>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h3>
