      <h2><strong>Identity, Values and Strengths Exploration</<strong></h2>

<hr size=10>
          <h3><b>1.	Gather evidence to identify what your personal values are. The reflection gets you to examine and identify who you are at this point,
this involves a self-evaluation and seeking feedback from two or three trusted friends, family, whanau, colleagues. This allows you to
compare how you see yourself, with how others see you.<b></h3>

<p><i>So, I starting to write this answer turned into a 1-page essay. But, to keep it simple, I would say my values are:
Honesty, Consideration for others, reliability, fairness, resilience, determination, tolerance.
If you analyse all these beliefs on face value there can be points of contention. So, each has a value to me, that
I personally believe hold value, but existentially considering them from many perspectives can break down their
reasoning to a point where they no longer represent what they mean to me. What I really mean to say is, each of us
is likely to have our own interpretation on what each of these truly mean.</i></p>

<hr size=10>

<h3><b> 2. Gather evidence to identify your strengths and areas for development. Evidence might include: personality or
skills/capability assessment tools like Myers Briggs, Strengthsfinder; DOPE; Capability Sort; Minded; task 1 examples.</b></h3>

<h2><b>Document it<b></h2>


<h2><b> Using the evidence gathered, describe your core personal values.</b></h2>
<hr size=10>
<h3>1. Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision
you made and the consequences of the action you took.</h3>
<hr>
<p><i>There was a situation at work where a employee was accused of bullying. I saw the list of complaints. many of which I knew to be lies, but not
all (as I was not there to see them all, but some I did see and these definitely did not happen in the manner explained. Its was a complicated
situation as it involved additional complaints of racism. I knew that many of the complaints were embellished or lies. some of which involved
assault and other misdemeanours. I felt that the motivation was to remove this individual so that the plaintiff would attain a large promotion
(which was the case). my action was to state my side of the story, which was to clarify what I saw in relation to misdemeanours for what they
truly where. I didn't speak out against many aspects of the complaints that did not know. but urged them to consider that, considering many
of the complaints were embellished and or lies that this should be factored into their decision. It did not sit well with me that this person
was lying about such a serious situation (a persons lively hood). I exposed myself by speaking out. the result was the worker was dismissed for
bullying and racism and yes the guy got the 30k promotion. I didn't like the dishonest behaviour. the job in question was extremely reliant on
honesty and integrity, which this person displayed they had none. It concerned me that management had such poor judgement in regard to promoting
a person to a position of responsibility over others, handling and maintaining records of explosives.</p></i>

<hr size=10>
<h3>2. Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity</h3>
<hr>
<i>Western culture is my ultimate influencer, I was brought up on Christian values, though I do not consider myself religious. they likely imprinted
a certain level of values and beliefs in me. I would say a key saying from this value base would be "do unto others, as you would have them do
unto you". This likely reflects who I am, I treat others as I would like to be treated. I try to be good to others and show everybody
the respect they deserve. I think manners are important, everyone deserves a chance to be themselves.  I'm a New Zealander which, I think holds
its own culture. The words I think of is friendly, relaxed, fun, tidy. Hopefully, I embody these assumption of NZ culture.</i>

<h2><b> Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.</b></h3>
<hr size=10>
<h3> 1. Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision
you made and the consequences of the action you took.</h3>

<i>as above really. I felt I acted well despite the outcome. I stood up for the truth. Which I think is important in an environment like that.</i>

<hr>
<h3>2. Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h3>
<i>Strengths and limitations in this regard, would like be that having cultural values can often conflict with other cultural values. something sacred to one may not be to another etc.</i>
<hr>

<h3>3. Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</h3>
<i>Currently my career development is low, which would make this a weakness. Also creating elements of doubt. I have discontinued one career to pursue another I have recently been focusing on education.
my learning skill have increased heavily since I start university, however I'm concerned I may not have retained everything I would like.</i>
<hr>

<h3>4. Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</h3>
<i>I feel I have a problem solving mind, apparently the personality tests agree. so that is likely to help me in the process of solving most of the obstacles</i>
<hr>

<h3>5. Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss
the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</h3>
<i>During my Uni studies, I encountered students in group work who did not have either the ability or the willingness to complete the task. The reason I as ability is that they did not have sufficient
English skills (yet) to complete the task at hand. It was very difficult to remain positive, when the work was presented to me, it was plagiarised. I became leader of the group, mainly because I seamed
to be the most motivated to complete the task and attain good grades. I tried very hard to be patient and inclusive, to have everyone contribute etc. Mainly due to the fact I had just completed a
course called leadership and teamwork... using these techniques sounds good, but i noticed there was a couple factors missing that are needed to make things work. motivation and authority. In our group,
one person just did not attend at all and contributed no work till the last minute which was all copy pasted from the internet, another found three or so sources of work from the internet put them
together and handed that in, and finally, another did decent work but really was not up to University standards. eventually it got to a point of removing one person from the group, another was asked
regularly to fix there work up and eventually the bulk of the work was rewritten by myself and another member of the group.

I felt that being patient, inclusive, caring and understanding can only go so far before tough words need to be said, if the some team members have not intention of actually doing the right thing.
If someone simple does not want to do something you just cant make them do it. only when i got tough did one in particular get the job done. I don't like being the bad guy and I don't appreciate people
through their own selfishness pressuring me to solve their own issues for the greater good of the team. I feel sometimes having principles only makes you more manipulable.

What was it like trying to summarise yourself to a group of strangers? Could you feel your ego? Were you self conscious?
was tough, the questions leave much to be explored. I ended up writing a very long analysis which grew off topic. Ego, I'm often more critical of myself than many others, so I feel odd if I say anything
resembling self-praise, we should not feel bad about our strengths, however, we must be aware of the blindness that can come from not considering the negative repercussions of our strengths. I naturally
resist being self serving or self praising in group environments as people don't respond well to this kind of behaviour as it resembles arrogance. Its better to be honest about your faults and round down
your strengths, until a rapport has been earned between the people you are with.
